      <div class="section-title">What Is Responsive Design?</div>
      <p>
        Responsive design ensures that websites and apps adjust gracefully across all screen sizes—from phones to desktops. It allows a single codebase to provide optimal experiences on any device using techniques like CSS media queries and flexible grids. It’s essential for usability and SEO in today’s mobile-driven world.

      <div class="section-title">Why Responsive Design Matters</div>
      <p>
        With over 60% of internet traffic coming from mobile devices and Google's mobile-first indexing, poor mobile performance can harm both user satisfaction and search rankings. Responsive design creates consistency across platforms, which builds user trust and ensures content is accessible and easy to interact with anywhere.

      <div class="section-title">Best Practices for Responsive UI Design</div>
      <h3>1. Flexible Layouts</h3>
      <p>
        Use fluid grids and breakpoints to adapt to screen sizes. For example, collapse three-column layouts into single columns on smaller devices. Prioritize key content for vertical scrolls on mobile.
    </p>
  
      <h3>2. Responsive Typography</h3>
      <p>
        Adjust font sizes and line lengths to remain readable across screens. Shorter lines and slightly smaller fonts help text stay clear on mobile devices.
    </p>
  
      <h3>3. Adaptive Navigation</h3>
      <p>
        Convert horizontal menus into hamburger menus or dropdowns on mobile. Ensure all sections are reachable, and use large tap targets for easier interaction on touchscreens.
    </p>
  
      <h3>4. Scalable Images & Media</h3>
      <p>
        Use HTML tags like <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> or <code>srcset</code> to deliver optimized images for different devices. Enable lazy loading and replace wide banners with mobile-friendly versions to save bandwidth and speed up loading.
    </p>
  
      <h3>5. Touch-Friendly Design</h3>
      <p>
        Design buttons and links with enough space for finger taps. Avoid hover-only interactions which don’t work on touchscreens.</p>
  
      <h3>6. Real Device Testing</h3>
      <p>
        Use real devices in addition to browser tools to spot layout or usability issues that only appear in hands-on mobile testing.
