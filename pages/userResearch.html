    <div class="section-title">Why User Research Matters</div>
    <p>User research helps uncover real user needs, validate design assumptions, and identify usability flaws. It's the foundation of user-centered design. Without it, designers risk basing decisions on assumptions, leading to poor user experiences.</p>
    <p>Modern design methods like Design Thinking begin with user research phases called “Empathize” or “Discovery” to understand user context before ideating solutions.</p>

    <h3>Qualitative Methods</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Interviews</li>
      <li>Usability testing</li>
      <li>Contextual inquiries</li>
      <li>Field studies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These offer deep insights into user motivations and challenges. For example, Airbnb improved global check-in by observing host-guest interactions.</p>

    <h3>Quantitative Methods</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Surveys</li>
      <li>A/B Testing</li>
      <li>Web analytics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These help track behavior patterns and measure user satisfaction at scale.</p>

    <div class="section-title">Integrating Research into the Design Process</div>
    <p>Research should inform every stage of the design cycle. Involving developers and product managers ensures alignment and shared understanding. Research is iterative—feedback from testing refines the product over time.</p>
    <p>Post-launch feedback and A/B tests help ensure the product continues to meet user needs.</p>

    <div class="section-title">Real-World Impact</div>
    <p>Case studies show the power of research:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Nielsen Norman Group reported 85% improved content findability after a site redesign based on usability testing.</li>
      <li>Google tests even minor UI elements like link color.</li>
      <li>Spotify blends user interviews with data analysis to improve personalized experiences.</li>
    </ul>

  <section>
    <div class="section-title">Conclusion</div>
    <p>User research injects empathy and evidence into the design process. Even basic methods like user interviews can dramatically improve usability and relevance. For beginners in UI/UX, developing a research mindset is crucial for creating meaningful and successful designs.</p>
    <p>As the saying goes: “Without data, you're just another person with an opinion.”</p>
