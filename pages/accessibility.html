    <p>
        Designing for accessibility ensures digital products are usable by all individuals, including those with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments. It's about inclusion, not just compliance. Like a public space designed for everyone, digital spaces should also be accessible to all.

    <p>Inclusive design goes beyond accessibility standards to benefit all users. For instance, large buttons help both users with motor impairments and people using a phone one-handed. Captions assist the deaf and those in noisy environments alike.</p>
