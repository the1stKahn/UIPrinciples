    <div class="section-title">What Are Microinteractions?</div>
    <p>
        A microinteraction is typically defined by its scope. It’s a contained product moment that revolves around a single task. For example, toggling a setting on or off is a microinteraction. When you flip a toggle switch in an app, you might hear a click or see the switch smoothly slide to indicate it’s now switched on. That little animation and state change is a microinteraction.  Microinteractions usually have four parts: a trigger (what initiates the event), rules (what happens when clicked), feedback (how it informs the user), and loops/modes (what happens if it repeats or the state it’s in).

    <div class="section-title">Why Microinteractions Matter</div>
    <h3>1. Feedback and System Status</h3>
    <p>They inform users that their actions were recognized. For example, a loading spinner or a button highlight confirms a click or input.</p>

    <h3>2. Preventing Errors</h3>
    <p>Disabling a submit button until a form is complete or showing helpful tooltips helps prevent mistakes. Hover states and visual cues guide interaction.</p>

    <h3>3. Emotional Engagement</h3>
    <p>Animations like Facebook reactions or Mailchimp’s "Rock On!" message add personality and joy, making the experience memorable and enjoyable.</p>

    <h3>4. Encouraging Behavior</h3>
    <p>Positive reinforcement like confetti animations or sound feedback when completing tasks encourages users to continue interacting.</p>

    <h3>5. Branding and Signature Moments</h3>
    <p>Unique microinteractions—like a signature sound or animation—can reinforce brand identity and enhance product distinctiveness.</p>

    <div class="section-title">Best Practices for Microinteractions</div>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Keep them subtle:</strong> They should support tasks without distracting.</li>
      <li><strong>Make them purposeful:</strong> Ensure each microinteraction adds value.</li>
      <li><strong>Stay consistent:</strong> Use the same feedback pattern across similar actions.</li>
      <li><strong>Optimize performance:</strong> Avoid laggy or battery-draining animations, especially on mobile.</li>
      <li><strong>Test and refine:</strong> Observe user reactions and refine animations based on feedback.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section-title">Real-World Examples</div>
    <h3>Typing Indicators in Messaging Apps</h3>
    <p>Apps like WhatsApp or Slack show a typing animation (e.g., three dots) to indicate someone is replying. It reassures the user that a response is coming and adds a human touch to digital communication.</p>

    <h3>Facebook Reaction Animation</h3>
    <p>Hovering over the Like button reveals animated emoji reactions. This microinteraction is both functional and emotional, letting users express themselves in richer ways with fun visual feedback.</p>

    <div class="section-title">Conclusion</div>
    <p>Microinteractions are powerful tools in a designer’s toolkit. Though small, they improve user feedback, usability, and emotional connection. By following best practices and aligning microinteractions with user needs and brand tone, designers can significantly elevate the user experience and make digital products more engaging and intuitive.</p>
